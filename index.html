                            <p> I already had Python's virtualenv package installed, so I created a new directory for Lab 1, initialized a venv named 'FastRobots_ble', and installed the required packages with pip.</p>

                            <p> BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, a communication protocol for wireless communication between devices that consumes little power. 
                                BLE utilizes the GATT profile, which is a peripheral-central model that defines device interactions. In our codebase, after establishing a Bluetooth connection to the Nano, the functions provided through imports in the 'demo.ipynb' allow us to read, write, and subscribe to characteristics that are advertised by our Nano board. 
                                The Nano runs 'ble_arduino.ino', which contains the RobotCommand class used to parse incoming commands from the laptop client, 
                                and a switch statement (defined in handle_command()) to determine and execute the corresponding commands that we will implement throughout the lab.

                            <ul> 2. The demo sketch printed out the Nano's MAC address which I made sure to left pad with 0s to get a full 12 hex address. I then updated the corresponding variable in the config .yaml file. </ul>

                            <ul> 3. I then generated a UUID to replace the existing BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy Characteristic) to avoid my computer connecting to other boards and updated this in the .yaml file as well. </ul>

                            <p> In my Jupyter Notebook, I used the bleak package's 'start_notify' function to start notifications on the ['RX_STRING'] uuid, and created a callback function called 'notification_handler' to convert the received byte arrays into printable strings.</p>

                            <p> I then wrote a loop function for my Arduino sketch that would continually send the current program time from the board using the millis() function for 10 seconds. </p>

                                Each transmission consisted of 1 float, or 32 bits (4 bytes) of data. The effective data transfer rate for my method was approximately:

                            <p>For this task, instead of sending time measurements as soon as my board sampled them, I added the following function called 'SEND_TIME_DATA' to my Arduino sketch:</p>

                            The function loops up to the size of 'datasize' to guard against overfilling the array, and fills 'timearray' with 50 sequential time samplings. </p>
                            <p>It then loops through the 'timearray' and sends each reading as a formatted timestamp string.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Discussion</div>
                            <p class = "fw-bold text-secondary"> Discuss the differences between these two methods, the advantages and disadvantages of both and the potential scenarios that you might choose one method over the other.</p>
                            <p>In the first method created in tasks 4 & 5, the speed at which data could be sent was limited by the sampling rate of the millis() and temperature functions. 
                            The board physically cannot transmit the time or temp readings at a rate faster than the functions take to run.
                            However, in the second method, where time and temperature measurements are precalculated and stored in arrays, the most direct limitation of the data transfer speed seems to 
                            be the clock frequency of the Nano's CPU and however many CPU cycles it takes to append a reading from memory to the writeable GATT characteristic.</p>

                            <p>I could see how the first method has an advantage of the data being closer to real-time measurements. In a real-time feedback use case, this would likely be the preferred choice between the two methods as the readings are more closely related to the physical time that the sampling was taken.
                            However, a disadvantage of this method is the decreased speed of data transfer and increased possibility of disruptions when measurements are sent. In a case where we are okay with not receiving immediate feedback from our peripheral device, and we want to instead just need to analyze actions of the bot after they have taken place, the second method might be a more reliable and faster choice.
                            A downside to this method however is the increased RAM utilization by creating extra data structures to hold measurements before sending them to the central device.

                            <p class = "fw-bold text-secondary">How “quickly” can the second method record data?</p>
    
                            <p>
                                The time taken to send the 50 messages was calculated using the recorded time difference between the first and last sample: 64 milliseconds. 
                                Assuming this rate remains constant, the estimated message transfer speed of the Nano with this method is approximately 
                                \( \frac{50}{0.064} \approx 781 \) messages per second. 
                                Sending just one 4-byte float, this results in an effective data transfer speed of:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                781 \times 4 = 3,124 \text{ bytes/second}
                                \]
                            </p>
                            <p class = "fw-bold text-secondary">The Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM. Approximately how much data can you store to send without running out of memory?</p>
                            If the Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM, and we stored each value as a float, which each comprised of 4 bytes, we could theoretically store at most 96,000 total floats, or 48,000 total timestamp and temperature reading pairs before the board ran out of memory.

                            <div class="subheading mb-3"> Implementing Low Pass Filter </div>
                    
                            <p> From Lecture 4, we are given the following recursive formula for a low pass filter: </p>

                            <div style = "text-align: center;">
                                <p> \(\theta_{\text{LPF}}[n] = \alpha \cdot \theta_{\text{RAW}} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \theta_{\text{LPF}}[n-1]\) </p>

                                <p> \(\theta_{\text{LPF}}[n-1] = \theta_{\text{LPF}}[n]\) </p>
                            </div>                 
                            
                            <p> However, we need to calculate a value for alpha using our selected cutoff frequency of 5Hz.</p>

                            <p> We can use the following equation for a RC low pass filter: </p>
                            <div style = "text-align: center;">
                                <p> \( f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}\)</p>
                            </div>
                            <p> Where \( f_c \) is our cutoff frequency, to then solve for RC in the following equation: </p>
                            <div style = "text-align: center;">
                            <p> \(\alpha = \frac{T}{T + RC} \) </p>
                            </div>
                            <p> To which we can finally solve for \(\alpha\).</p>
                            <p> Substituting a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz in for \( f_c \), we obtain a value of 0.318 seconds for the RC time constant.  </p>
                            <p> When sending data over to my laptop, I calculated my sampling frequency to be about 400 samples/s or a sampling period of approx. 0.0025 seconds. </p>
                            <p> Substituting these two values into our last equation, we obtain an \(\alpha\) of approximately 0.078.</p>

                            <p> Below is a code snippet from my LPF implementation:</p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/evnleong/8c76b7b8625c2f00fc0af4220aaad986.js"></script>

                            <p> And these are the results of the LPF on both Pitch and Roll data from the accelerometer overlaid over the raw data:</p>

                            <p> Using the following equations to calculate Pitch, Roll and Yaw from angular velocity of the gyroscope:</p>

                            <p> I added code to my Nano sketch to compute and store the output of these formulas (a relevant code snippet is shown below): </p>

                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/evnleong/9c863d474d95458d3a3646455a5fa8ea.js"></script>

                            <p>I chose to plot the output of the gyroscope as I rotated it between 0, 90, and -90 deg. angles and overlay it with both the raw and filtered pitch and roll values from the accelerometer. 
                            (Since gravity does not have a component along the yaw axis, I could not directly compare the gyroscope's yaw data with the accelerometer's
                             measurements, as the accelerometer only detects linear acceleration and cannot measure rotational motion around the yaw axis.)
                            </p>

                            <p> Although the time period of data collection was brief, as can be seen in the plot above, I noticed that compared to the accelerometer, 
                                the gyroscope tends to slightly drift over time after rotations, even when reverting back to its original angle. This drifting appears to be okay during the short window shown above, but over long time periods this drift accumulates.
                                Additionally, compared to the raw accelerometer data, the raw gyroscope data had far less noise, seemingly less than even my filtered accelerometer data. 
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p> Lastly to test my yaw formula, I attempted to oscillate the IMU in the yaw axis between -90 deg , back to 0 deg , and 90 deg within the 5 second sampling window: </p>

                            <p> I applied a complementary filter to my IMU data to compute pitch and roll more accurately with higher stability with the following code: </p>

                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/evnleong/6b0d77e912554c613b6ac38b38dfb89d.js"></script>
                           
                            <p> I selected the value for comp_alpha to be 0.3 as I trusted the accelerometer's data more than the gyroscope, but still wanted to strike a balance between the high sensitivity and noise of the accelerometer and the drifting of the gyroscope.</p>
                            

                            <p class = "fw-bold">  Demonstrate its working range and accuracy, and that it is not susceptible to drift or quick vibrations.</p>
                            <p> To demonstrate the effectiveness of the complementary filter, I placed the IMU on a table at rest, and shook it at two intervals during the sampling period.
                                I then plotted a graph for each measurement.</p>
                            <p> As shown below, the complementary filter tries to strike a balance between the sensitive accelerometer and the drifiting gyroscope. I did notice that the complementary filter output does still drift slightly due to the contributions from the gyroscope, but at the same time it has reduced a lot of the high frequency noise from the shaking table,
                                 while still remaining responsive to subtle changes in pitch and roll that would have been missed by just the gyroscope alone.</p>

                            <p class = "fw-bold"> How quickly are you able to sample new values?</p>
                            <p> Removing any extraneous print statements and delays, I was able to sample 2048 samples in approximately 4996 milliseconds. The equivalent sample rate was approximately 400 samples per second.  </p>
                            <p class = "fw-bold"> Does your main loop on the Artemis run faster than the IMU produces new values?</p>
                            <p> My main loop on the Artemis does run faster than the IMU produces new values. In my implementation, the IMU cannot retrieve a sample unless the call to myICM.dataReady() returns true, whereas the main loop can continue to execute regardless of the return value of the function. </p>

                            <p class = "fw-bold"> Consider if it makes sense to have one big array, or separate arrays for storing accelerometer and gyroscope data, argue for your choice. </p>
                            <p> In my implementation, I chose to use multiple, separate arrays in order to store my gyroscope and accelerometer data. I felt that this made the most logical sense to me, 
                                and allowed me to easily differentiate between the different data sources when transmitting my data over BLE. </p>
                            
                            <p class = "fw-bold"> Consider the best data type to store your data. Should you use string, floats, double, integers? Justify your decision. </p>
                            <p>The primary data type I chose to store all of my data as was float. This is because the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data required precision with decimal values and floats provide the necessary precision while being memory efficient (compared to double).
                                However, if I were to optimize further, I might consider switching from float to uint32_t for storing time values (such as those obtained from millis()), as millis() returns an integer value. Using uint32_t would likely be more appropriate for storing time because it's a positive integer value and avoids the unnecessary overhead of floating-point representation.
                                That said, I decided to stick with floats throughout for consistency across all data types. Additionally, since the memory space for storing uint32_t and float is identical, I didn't consider the trade-off significant enough to change the data type. </p>
                            <p class = "fw-bold">  Consider the memory of the Artemis; how much memory can you allocate to your arrays? What does that correspond to in seconds?</p>
                            <p> Assuming that the Artemis has the full 384 kB of RAM available to allocate to the arrays, and assuming that each sample stores  4 float data points (Roll, Pitch, Yaw, and Timestamp), this would result in:</p>

                            <p>
                                So, at most 24,000 samples can be stored in total.

                                Assuming 400 samples can be collected per second, the time it would take to use up the available memory is:
                            </p>

                            <p>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So, under these assumptions, you would be able to sample for approximately 1 minute before the available memory is exhausted.
